== Overview

A very simple Electron boilerplate that sets up an app whose application logic is handled by a Lisp child process, whose UI is handled by Electron, and whose persistence is handled by SQLite. Uses sbcl with quicklisp and Hunchentoot to build the Lisp helper process, and electron-packager to build delivered apps.
